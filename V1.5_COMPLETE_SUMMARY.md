## 📊 Silicon Alley Reporter Integration (Pending)

Jason Calacanis has been contacted about access to the original Silicon Alley Reporter digital files. Once received:

1. Create scraper to extract:
   - People mentioned
   - Companies covered
   - Events/dates
   - Articles/stories
2. Auto-populate database with:
   - New people records
   - Timeline events
   - Connections between people
3. Feed into agent knowledge base
4. Create "Silicon Alley Reporter Archive" section

**Awaiting**: Response from Calacanis with Google Drive link or archive access

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

1. **LinkedIn scraping**: May be blocked by LinkedIn on public IPs. Works better with:
   - Public profiles only
   - Possible need for proxy or API
   - Alternative: Let users paste their resume/bio

2. **Voice recording**: Requires HTTPS (works on Vercel, not localhost without cert)

3. **Interview agent**: Currently asks 3 questions. Could be made dynamic based on story richness.
